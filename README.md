## Development
To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following yarn commands.

- export start. Start the app in the Expo.
- yarn android
- yarn ios
- yarn web

 You can also open up the projects in the ios and android directories with their respective IDEs.
 expo-updates (​https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/master/packages/expo-updates/README.md​) has been installed in your project.
 Before you do a release build, you'll need to configure a few values in Expo.plist and AndroidManifest.xml in order for updates to work.
